# CS1436ExtraCredit

Program Requirements
Use a const to define the maximum number of items (MAX ITEMS =
10). 

Implement a switch-based menu with the following options:
(1) Add a new item.
(2) View all inventory items in a tabular format.
(3) Calculate the total value of the inventory.
(4) Exit the program.

Furthermore, validate all user inputs (e.g., ensure non-negative values
for quantities and prices). Your program is to require prices not to
exceed $10,000 and quantities bounded from 1 âˆ’ 1000.


For another hint, you might use at least three functions:
(1) A function to add items to the inventory.
(2) A function to display the inventory in tabular format.
(3) A function to calculate and return the total value.

Use procedural programming techniques only. Though this be for extra
credit, the standards of the programming assignments and the labs
remain.

Bonus Requirements (Optional)
Implement file I/O to save the inventory to a file and load it back
during a later session. Use a default file name (e.g., inventory.txt)
and format the saved data as: ItemName, Quantity, Price. Handle
errors if the file cannot be opened or is incorrectly formatted.
